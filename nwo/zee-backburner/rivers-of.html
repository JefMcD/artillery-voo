<h1>Inspired by tales of the Underworld in Greek mythology. When a soul passed away they were ferried across the river Styxx by Charon to the underworld. Here there would be trials to undergo and several rivers to cross one of which was the river Lethe. They would bathe and drink from it, and each time they would forget a little of their past life until they forgot everything and were ready to be re-born. <br />
The hair is weaving through the water and knotted with remnants of their life tangled up in there, like skulls, combs fish, hearts and various other remnants. Floating and the body is like a map with sunrises and directions scattered around. </h1>
