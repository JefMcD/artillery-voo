        <div class="pic-story">

            <div class="story-box">
                Immanuel Kant was one of the men who propelled humanity into the
                Age of Enlightennment and Reason. Where Science would rule over
                superstition and Inquiry would rule over Blind Faith. Not long
                before that, the consensus of opinion was that the Earth was Flat
                and it was beset by Werewolves, Ghosts, Demons, Vampires and all
                manner of Devils. To Stay Safe in these dangerous times the savvy
                medieval folk would carry an assortment of tokens, potions and
                talismans that deterred Beelzebub and his unholy cohorts from
                leading them into death or temptation and damnation. Precautionary
                Measures which were without doubt Highly Safe and effective. For
                example, Practically nobody wearing a rosary made out of garlic was
                ever attacked by a vampire.
                People being people, there’s always going to be a few nutters who
                like to think they’re smarter than everybody else by asking awkward
                questions and asking for proof. Trouble was, to question any of the
                dogma meant that you denied God, The Bible and the experts of the
                Church, and For this you paid a hefty price. You were censored,
                Excluded from Society, persecuted, Tortured and possibly Burned at
                the Stake especially if you also happened to be a Witch.
                Its easy to imagine that our ancestors were dumb or silly and a lot
                were but they were no different from you or I. No doubt there were a
                good few who knew it was mostly all bullshit but they figured it was
                Better just to shut up and play along, I mean all it takes is for
                one pissed off old Hag to call you a witch or say you're possessed
                by demons and you'll be served up on a Flaming Bonfire - with a dab
                of Holy water thrown in to purify your soul on its journey to Hell.
                Right?
            </div>


            <div class="story-box">
                Fast Forward 500 years of scientific discovery and One Couf
                Plandemic and how does it compare. Instead of the Church we have
                Mainstream Media as the appointed arbiters of truth, and SCIENCE a
                manifest infallible God. Broadcasting their sermons of fire and
                Brimstone with promises of eternal damnation to the unbelievers from
                the corner of your Socially Isolated, Lockdown Living Room. With
                Social Media (Pharma Funded)Fact Checkers cherry picking carefully
                crafted data, demonising dissenters and flat out denial of the truth
                to keep all the heretics from stepping out of line - and for those
                brave souls who do step out of line, our equivalences of old
                fashioned medieval persecution being ... modern persecution!
                Threats, bans, social exclusion, demonisation, job loss, doxxing,
                cancel culture... They may not literally burn people at the stake
                (yet) but they can turn your life into a Bonfire if you dare to have
                what they consider to be an 'unacceptable opinion'. The heretics of
                old are now labeled 'conspiracy theorists', 'right wing extremists',
                'anti-vaxxer', 'racist', 'homophobes', 'islamaphobes',
                'science-denier'. Everything except consorting with the Devil - any
                slurs they can think of to fan the flames of hate and division are
                fair game. It's a sign of the times we live in that anyone, whether
                it be a Trucker or a Nobel Prize winner who questions the scientific
                dogma of Big Pharma and their bought scientists are
                labeled 'anti-science' and a conspiracy theorist by the Church of
                Covid .

                Most incredible of all is that, unlike our medieval forebears, we
                live at a time where we have access to information direct from the
                source, yet huge numbers of people have deliberately kept themselves
                ignorant and uninformed, actively self censoring and making
                themselves dependent exclusively on sources of information that are
                approved and endorsed by the Corporate State; BBC, CNN, SkyNews,
                MSNBC, RTE the Tabloid Press and much more. Despite the fact they
                have shown themselves day after day to be fear mongering liars,
                biased, divisive and totalitarian. Not only that, many get angry at
                anyone offering an alternative viewpoint and will defend the
                corporate interests of global conglomerate pharma corporations than
                the health and well being of themselves and their children.
                Dutifully Trusting the propaganda machines and putting their faith
                in Media Sources that receive the bulk of their funding from Govt
                and from Big Pharma and who are nothing more than mouthpieces for
                the Biomedical and Globalist totalitarian State.

            <div class="story-box">
                If you've wondered over the last couple of years how its strange
                that the mainstream media in every country seems to act as one, you
                may be interested to know that this is what has been termed 'The
                Trusted News Initiative' created by the BBC in 2019 and encompasses
                all major media broadcasters and publishers to ensure that the
                Corporate State has total control over the information you are
                allowed to see or hear. Thus controlling public opinion. Their
                purpose is to censor information, silence and marginalise anyone who
                presents anything that could undermine their lies, their profits,
                their control and their Communist/Totalitarian Agenda. But Its
                nothing new. Propaganda, Censorship and Oppression has been the
                hallmark of every totalitarian regime that has ever existed, as is
                the claim that its for your safety and well-being.

                As the old saying goes Knowledge is Power and the Truth will set you
                free if you let it. We're living through a New Dark Age, but Light
                will always destroy the darkness when you let it shine. The British
                Parliament is currently discussing how to abolish human rights and
                you might ask why would they do that? Well, the logical conclusion
                is that they want to do things that violates Human Rights. The time
                has come for us all to set aside any differences we may have had and
                unite together in opposition to these tyrants and tell them where
                they can go. Thats what they fear. Enough Is Enough. The Truckers in
                Canada are showing us the way forward and what can be achieved when
                we are united. Regardless of race, religion or sexuality, We all
                want the same things. The Freedom to live life and to thrive and
                find happiness.
