            This is Artillery Voo and my nams is is Jef McD.<br>
            I'm an artist born and bread in Scotland, a formerly
            free Country with rich history and unique culture destroyed
            by Globalist WEF despots and Wokery. Here you'll get a dose of
            antidote to the Woke Mind Virus. Contained wIthin these deplorable

            obedience of my fellow man and how they gleefully collaborated with tyranny and absurdity. I dont think
            I will ever get over that. You Know? Knowing <b>that</b> horror exists in most people. Well anyway, I
            have to do <i>something</i> and this is what I got
